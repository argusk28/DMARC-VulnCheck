Speed and precision—that's what DMARC-VulnCheck is
Thanks to parallel processing it runs each task in a separate process, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores. 

Use it when you have a list of domains that need to be checked for DMARC misconfiguration

Simply type in your terminal: python3 code.py domain_list.txt

The tool is intended to check for p=none policy at the moment which means an attacker can spoof the domain to send emails
